Christian Hedonists aim to make the pursuit of joy *in God* our life’s work. Which is not at odds with devoting our lives to God’s glory — because God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.

But *Christian* Hedonists must, in time, say more about the object of our joy than simply “in God.” Not any so-called “God” will do. Our souls will not be deeply and enduringly happy, and our purpose in this life (and forever) will not be fulfilled, if we do not find our heart’s satisfaction in the true God, the God who is, the God who has revealed himself as “the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” ([Romans 15:6](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%2015.6); [2 Corinthians 1:3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Cor%201.3); [11:31](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Corinthians%2011.31); [Ephesians 1:3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%201.3), [17](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ephesians%201.17); [Colossians 1:3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Col%201.3); [1 Peter 1:3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Pet%201.3)).

But how do we know this God’s defining features? What is it about the *Christian* God that distinguishes him from the false gods to which billions globally bow the knee? Does our God, the true God, have a defining mark or a defining moment?

## God’s Defining Moment

For Christians, our defining mark is a particular person: Jesus Christ. We believe that God himself, in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, lived among us as one of us. He took on our flesh and blood and full humanity. The eternal Word, the second person of the Trinitarian Godhead, “became flesh and dwelt among us” (John 1:14).

> “The defining moment of Jesus’s life — from Good Friday to Easter Sunday — has become for us God’s defining moment.”

But the true God gives us not only a defining person but also a defining moment. The four Gospel accounts bear witness to a clear climactic moment in the 30-plus-year life of Jesus of Nazareth: he died an excruciating death on the cross for sins not his own and rose three days later vindicated. The defining moment of Jesus’s life — from Good Friday to Easter Sunday — has become for us God’s defining moment. Because in the death and resurrection of his Son, God secured for us at least three priceless realities essential for real, deep, and enduring joy.



## Omnipotent Wrath Removed

Without the cross of Christ, there is no Christian Hedonism. Because we are miserable sinners, and God is the indestructibly happy God, we will never taste real joy unless God acts to remove what we cannot: the barrier our sin erects between us and him. The very nature of sin is insurrection against God’s joy and our joy in him. Because the highest and deepest grounds of God’s own joy is himself (he has no other gods before him), sin is not just a barrier; it’s an assault.

So, the first priceless reality that God himself must secure, if he is to make possible for his people their full and lasting joy, is the removal of his righteous wrath against us because of our sin. Which he does through his own Son supplying “the blood of the covenant” (Hebrews 10:29).

On the night Jesus died, he took a cup, gave thanks for it, and said, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins” (Matthew 26:28; Mark 14:24; also 1 Corinthians 11:25). In ancient times, formal agreements (covenants) often were ratified by both parties pledging their faithfulness through shedding (animal) blood, and applying it to themselves, to portray the gravity of the arrangement. The ritual communicated, in essence, “May my blood likewise be shed if I do not keep the terms of this covenant.” The Mosaic covenant is Scripture’s signature example of such a two-party covenant, with shed blood sprinkled on both the people and on the altar, to represent God (Exodus 24:3–8).

But not all covenants were inaugurated by both parties shedding (symbolic) blood. When God made a covenant with Abram, for example, God alone took to himself the blood of the covenant as he passed through the sacrificial pieces, while Abram slept (Genesis 15:7–21). In doing so, he said, in effect, “As surely as I am God, my promise to you will come to pass. It is not conditional on you. I will surely do it.”

> “At the cross, Christ secured the joy of the new covenant and became the most glorious object of our joy.”

The new covenant, inaugurated by the shedding of Jesus’s blood, is like the covenant with Abram, not like the covenant with Moses. God himself, in the person of his Son incarnate, alone spills the blood of the covenant to remove his righteous wrath against his people and utterly secure, for those who are his, his eternal favor. The blood of the covenant has already been spilled. The removal of God’s wrath against those who are in Christ is certain.

However, more is required, and more is included, in Jesus’s costly purchase.
